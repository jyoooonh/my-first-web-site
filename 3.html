            The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to
            non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[11] The
            lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser,
            Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[12][13]

            During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic
            behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development
            scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They
            pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming
            language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]

            Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax
            similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language
            and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in
            September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][14]

            The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the
            time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a
            marketing ploy by Netscape.[15]
